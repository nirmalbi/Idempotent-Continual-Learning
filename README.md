## 3. Installation

### 3.1. Environment


Our model can be learnt in a **single GPU RTX-4090 24G**

```bash
conda env create -f environment.yaml
conda activate icl
```

The code was tested on Python 3.9 and PyTorch 1.13.0.


### 3.2. Datasets
#### 3.2.1 CIFAR and Tiny-ImageNet
* Using **CIFAR10, CIFAR100 and Tiny-ImageNet** for failure prediction (also known as misclassification detection).
* We keep **10%** of training samples as a validation dataset for failure prediction. 
* Download datasets to ./data/ and split into train/val/test.
Take CIFAR10 for an example:
```
cd data
bash download_cifar.sh
```
The structure of the file should be:
```
./data/CIFAR10/
├── train
├── val
└── test
```
