IDER is a novel framework for continual learning based on the idempotent property, which mitigates catastrophic forgetting and improves prediction reliability. It is a simple and robust method that can be easily integrated into other state-of-the-art approaches.

## 1. Quick Start

### 1.1. Environment



Clone this repository and install the requirements. Our model can be learnt in a **single GPU RTX-4090 24G**

```bash
conda env create -f environment.yaml
conda activate icl
```
The code was tested on Python 3.10 and PyTorch 1.13.0.


### 1.2. Training

Train and evaluate ResNet18 on different datasets using ER and ER+ID with different buffers. Run the following command:

<details>
<summary><b>CIFAR-10</b></summary>
    
```bash
bash run_para_cifar10.sh
``` 
</details>
<details> <summary><b>CIFAR-100</b></summary>
    
```bash
bash run_para_cifar100.sh
```
</details>
<details> <summary><b>TinyImageNet</b></summary>
    
```bash
bash run_para_tinyimg.sh
```
</details>

## 2. Reproduced Results
After the paper has been accepted, we rerun everything to provide complete logs and checkpoints for our Table 1 in the paper. The example results are ResNet18 on different datasets using ER and ER+ID as baseline methods with different buffers and 0-4 seeds.

Checkpoint

The checkpoints are saved under experiments folder.


## 3. Tools
<details>
<summary><b>mlflow visulization</b></summary>
    
1. Setup
    
```bash
pip install mlflow
```

2. All results are stored in mlflow under the repository mlruns. You can run mlflow ui server locally:
```bash
mlflow ui
```
And then go to http://127.0.0.1:5000/#/ in your brower to see all the results from the experiments we runned and exact hyperparameters used in each run.
